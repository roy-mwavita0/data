## Projects and Achievements

### 1. Preventive Analyzer Dashboard

The **Preventive Analyzer Dashboard**, which I created, enables team members to upload raw reports and automatically gain insights into the progress of preventive, evidence-based interventions. This dashboard specifically focuses on tracking the progress of **Sinovuyo** and **Coaching Boys Into Men (CBIM)** programs, providing key performance metrics that support data-driven decisions and program improvements

### 2. OVC Comprehensive Gaps Analyzer Dashboard

The **OVC Comprehensive Gaps Analyzer Dashboard**, which I developed, allows team members to upload registration lists and automatically identify key gaps in data. This includes detecting issues such as overage and duplicated birth certificates, helping the team to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

### 3. Epidemic Control Dashboard

The **Epidemic Control Dashboard**, which I designed, provides real-time insights into the viral cascade and the efforts towards achieving the UNAIDS tripped 95 agenda. It allows the team to track and monitor critical data points, facilitating more informed decision-making in improving response strategies.

### 4. Performance Trends Dashboard

The **Performance Trends Dashboard**, which I developed, provides detailed insights into key performance indicators, including the **Birth Certificate Trend** and **Case Plan Achievement Trend**. The **Birth Certificate Trend** tracks the progress of acquiring birth certificates over time, highlighting any gaps or areas needing attention. The **Case Plan Achievement Trend** allows the team to monitor the completion and effectiveness of case plans, ensuring that goals are being met and adjustments are made as necessary to improve outcomes.
